ZK-SNARKS are super complicated and extremely slow to compute on arbitrary data. Thus, they are useful for proving how smart you are, and that's about it.

zmg, a library by the IPFS devs attempts to encrypt messages with the ZCash protocol which uses ZK-SNARKS. Messages take MINUTES to compute. MINUTES.

These are short messages.

ez-zk achieves zero knowledge proofs in fractions of the time and is easy to understand.
